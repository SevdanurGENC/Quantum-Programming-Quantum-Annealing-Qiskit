Stochastic hill climbing maintains a single candidate solution and takes steps of a random but constrained size from the candidate in the search space.

    "The main difference is that new points that are not as good as the current point (worse points) are accepted sometimes. A worse point is accepted probabilistically where the likelihood of accepting a solution worse than the current solution is a function of the _temperature_ of the search and how much worse the solution is than the current solution. Moving to worse solutions allow escaping from local minima. The temperature is decreased gradually, making unfavorable changes less probable as the process continues. 0 temperature is simply the hill climbing algorithm.  "
